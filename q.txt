really i just did not get why do we need exclusive queue for rpc, like it can be not exclusive, or i do not understand something, and why you close the connection after client gets response, why you do it and why do not akn the message. While I was going without interned connection, i was thinking why queue is exclusive, you will look in my notes, the main idea is that it is used that while consuming we did not use message that does not belong to client, because it will disappear while we check correlation id and nack it. Also correlation id is just made like for addition verification that message is that we need: YOU NEED TO DECLARE EXCLUSIVE QUEUE FOR EVERY CLIENT QUESTION BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE JUST ONE QUEUE, AFTER EACH CLIENT WILL TAKE THE MESSAGE IN THIS QUEUE, AND THIS WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME BECAUSE EACH TIME IF CORRELATION ID IS INVALID, WE NEED TO NACK MESSAGE, AND IF WE MAKE EXCLUSIVE QUEUE, QUEUE WILL HAVE ONLY ONE MESSAGE, AND THE SPEED WILL BE ON THE TOP, BECUASE EVERY TIME CLIENT PICKS ONLY MESSAGE THAT BELONGS TO IT, NOT FOR ANOTHER CLIENT, AND CORRELATION ID IS USED ONLY FOR УБЕЖДЕНИЯ THAT THE MESSAGE EXACTLY THAT CLIENT NEED
